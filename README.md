This is my first try at flutter web, inspired from mtechviral YouTube channel. As used in the sample, velocity_x package is the ui framework. This package offers many features and, among others, offers good flexibility for responsive parts of the project.

For me,this project is a starting point for a Flutter web application.

This repo is inspired from:
